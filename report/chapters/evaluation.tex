\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section we will reflect on the final results from this project, and whether we have met our overall aims. And the design principles used through the undertaking of the project.

\subsection{Design principles}
\label{subsec:design_principles}

Through the project I tried to keep as close to good OOP paradigms and design as possible. Creating a effective tool that anyone could use. As stated in the introduction the main was to build tool that anyone could use to debug their own databases, with the five main features visualisation, live updating, executing SQL and browsing data. Wrapped up within a user interface. 
\\\\
With support for other database system when needed, just by extending the interfaces and providing an implementation. In addition to sticking to good OPP design, I used TDD ( Test driven development ) in order to make sure that the final application, would work under a variety of circumstances. In the end I can safely say they theses aims where achieved. With the exception, of the lock byte and pointer map pages. 

\subsection{The System}
\label{subsec:system_eval}

The application its self though built in Java does not have many performance hiccups or other issues. 
\\\\
TODO: TALK ABOUT SYSTEM PERFORMANCE, HOW LONG IT TAKE TO PARSE THE DATABASE.

\subsection{User interface}
\label{subsec:user_interface_eval}

TODO EVAL THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN WHEN FINISHED.
mention about table view collect data from current database rather then the live version.
