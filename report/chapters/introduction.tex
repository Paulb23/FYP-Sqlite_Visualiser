\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Sqlite unlike many other databases is a small, single file, self-contained database engine often used in embedded systems, storage or as an application file. Sqlite is used in many applications such as Firefox, Android and Windows 10. In addition to its wide adaptation Sqlite is server less, and has zero configuration putting it in a unique place among the other alternative systems. Despite the extensive research and testing performed on Sqlite none have attempted to visualise this data in real time. \\\\
This paper will  help provide a way to see the Sqlite database in action, providing a useful tool for developers and researchers alike in understanding and debugging the internal structure of their own databases. In order to accomplish this we will: 

\begin{itemize}  

\item Explore in depth the how the file format is put together ( section~\ref{sec:background} ). And how to traverse the file ( section~\ref{sec:background} ).

\item Look at the design and development ( section~\ref{sec:design}  ) including testing ( section~\ref{sec:testing} ) of my tool. And how it takes this data and visualises it ( section~\ref{sec:implementation} ). Including the user experience ( section~\ref{sec:system_operation} ).

\item Evaluation of my tool ( section~\ref{sec:evaluation} ) and where this research could be taken beyond this paper ( section~\ref{sec:conclusion} ).

\end{itemize}
