\subsubsection{The SQLite header layout}
\label{subsub:header_layout}
Table~\ref{tbl:sqlite_header} show the header layout.  All multibyte fields are stored in a big-endian format.

\begin{longtable}[h]{| c | c | p{10cm} |}
		\hline
			\textbf{Byte Offset} & \textbf{Byte Size} & \textbf{Description} \\ 
		\hline
		\endhead
			0 & 16 & A UTF-8 Header String followed by null terminator read as: "SQLite format 3" or in hex: "53 51 4c 69 74 65 20 66 6f 72 6d 61 74 20 33 00". \\
		\hline
			16 & 2 & Page Size 	in bytes, power of two between 512 - 65536 bytes. if using version 3.7.0.1 and earlier between 512 - 32768, or 1 for 65536. \\
		\hline
			18 & 1 & Write version, 1 for legacy; 2 for WAL. \\
		\hline
			19 & 1 & Read version, 1 for legacy; 2 for WAL. \\
		\hline
			20 & 1 & Bytes of unused space at the end of each page. This space is used by extensions, such as cryptographic to store a checksum, but normally 0. \\
		\hline
			21 & 1 & Maximum embedded payload fraction, must be 64. Was going to be used to determine the maximum size of a B-Tree cell on a index B-Tree. \\
		\hline
			22 & 1 & Minimum embedded payload fraction, must be 32. Was going to be used to determine the portion of a B-Tree cell that has one or more overflow pages on a index B-tree. \\
		\hline
			23 & 1 & Leaf payload fraction, must be 32. Was going to be used to determine the portion of a B-Tree cell that has one or more overflow pages on a leaf or table B-Tree. \\
		\hline
			24 & 4 & File change counter. It counts the number of times the database is unlocked after being modified. May not be incremented in WAL mode. \\
		\hline
			28 & 4 & Size of the database in pages, Total number of pages. \\
		\hline
			32 & 4 & Page number of first freelist page, or 0 if no freelist. \\
		\hline
			36 & 4 & Number of freelist pages. \\
		\hline
			40 & 4 & Schema Cookie. The schema version, each time the schema is modified this number is incremented. \\
		\hline
			44 & 4 & Schema format number. either 1, 2, 3 or 4. \newline
			1. Format support back to version 3.0.0. \newline
			2. Varying number of columns within the same table. From Version 3.1.3. \newline 
			3. Extra column can be non-NULL values. From Version 3.1.4. \newline
			4. Respects DESC keyword and boolean type. From Version 3.3.0. \newline \\
		\hline
			48 & 4 & Page cache size. suggestion only towards Sqlite's pager. \\
		\hline
			52 & 4 & Page number of largest root B-Tree, when in vacuum mode else 0. \\
		\hline
			56 & 4 & Text encoding. \newline
			 1 for UTF-8. \newline 
			 2 for UTF-816le. \newline 
			 3 for UTF-816be. \\
		\hline
			60 & 4 & User version. Set by and read by the user, not used by Sqlite. \\
		\hline
			64 & 4 & Incremental-vacuum mode. Non 0 for true. 0 for false \\
		\hline
			68 & 4 & Application ID. Used to associate the database with a application. 0 is Sqlite3 Database \\
		\hline
			72 & 20 & Empty, Reserved for expansion. \\
		\hline
			92 & 4 & Version-valid-for-number. Value of the change counter when the Sqlite version number was stored. \\
		\hline
			96 & 4 & Version. Sqlite version. \\
