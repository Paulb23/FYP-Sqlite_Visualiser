\section*{\centering Abstract}
\begin{center}
	This paper presents a tool designed to visualise the internal workings of a SQLite database file. We start by looking at the SQLite history, systems and file format. Finding out the file is a series of fixed sized chunks / pages, and each page is a node in a much larger B-Tree structure. We then look at a model-view-controller style application that can then parse, and present this data in real time, while other systems access the file. And finish off looking at how the tool could be improved by .... and a future project could look at the changes made to the database and turn them back into the original SQL queries.
