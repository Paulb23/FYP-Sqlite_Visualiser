\section*{\centering Abstract}
\begin{center}
	This paper presents a tool designed to visualise the internal workings of a SQLite database. We start of by 	   looking at and understanding that the file format is split into pages, and each page is a node in a much larger B-Tree structure. We then look at a model-view-controller style application that can then parse, and present this data in real time, while other systems access the database. And finish off looking at how the tool could be improved by .... and a future project could look at the changes made to the database and turn them into the original SQL queries.
